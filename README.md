IMPORTANCE OF DATA TYPES IN THE ICT INDUSTRY, PROGRAMMING, AND PYTHON

Data is one of the building blocks of a solid computing, digital and physical networking environment. I like to think of the contribution of data in the computing and networking world as objects of communication between two of more conversing bodies. 

People communicate with one another by simulating their thoughts using devices like mobile devices, computers, TV and others which by design have components or elements that can hold data and output the data in a structured way to form what is known as information. Information is what is converted to form knowledge, then from knowledge to wisdom. 

The ICT industry provides efficient and faster modes of communication in the form of different technologies to structure and share data in packages that are patterned to form information to be sent to the receiver. 

All of this is just a summary of the communication process of information using different technologies to access a wider audience, to share content that can be intuitively understood by the conversing parties.

I write this to keep it as my notes to help me connect the importance of data types in programming.
